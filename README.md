**Application Name:** Course-O-Matic

**Project Topic / Objective:** The Course-O-Matic is a single-page desktop application designed to be used in conjunction with NEIUPort to 
- Track major requirements automatically.
- Find prerequisites automatically.
- Optimize a student’s course-sequence automatically.
- Create a course plan that suits the student’s interests and fits their schedule.

**Motivation:**
The NEIUPort portal students use for looking up and registering for classes is a nightmare to use. One can easily end up with 10+ open tabs in order keep track of all the data for a couple courses while planning a semester. Exploring what-if situations is almost impossible without the help of an advisor; the information is too spread out across multiple pages. This application is to make course planning easier. 

**Server-Side Components:**
Database with:
-	Course numbers, names, descriptions
-	Course section information such as instructor, room, meeting dates
-	A data structure representing the various sequences of prerequisites and other requirements for each course and major. 
-	Course-of-study plans saved by the student
-	Login/password info for users
